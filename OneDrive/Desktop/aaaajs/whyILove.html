        <ul>
            <li>He was born into a family with limited means and started selling newspapers as a child to supplement his family's income</li>
            <li>When his co-worker could not take his child for a carnival, Dr. Kalam himself accompanied the kid to the fair.</li>
            <li>He was the first President to be sworn in without hailing from a political background. He was a scientist before and a
            teacher after his Presidency tenure</li>
            <li>In the Rashtrapati Bhawan, he often had his meals on the floor along with the staff who worked with him.</li>
            <li>He was the cleanest politician India had ever seen and remained uninvolved in political nuances even during his tenure.</li>
